# Image â†’ ASCII
## In this project I've developed some UI to change configurations in the conversion of an image (png/jpg) to ASCII characters inside a canvas in HTML.
## It was used P5.js, which you can learn more about it here: [<img style="height: 30px;" src="https://p5js.org/assets/img/p5js.svg">](https://p5js.org/)

### You can see a preview of the page/project in the following picture:
### (Ps: After converting the image, you can right click it to save it to your computer!)

### For future updates:
1. Option to change the output resolution (for saving images in high quality).
2. Adding the option to change the background color as well as the letters color.
3. Adding an option to put some gradient overlay in the letters.
4. Adding some presets to the ASCII Shader string.
